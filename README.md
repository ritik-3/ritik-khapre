# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default defineConfig([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    # Personal Portfolio

    Modern, clean personal portfolio built with:

    - React + Vite + TypeScript
    - Tailwind CSS (Tailwind v4 + Vite plugin)
    - Framer Motion (subtle animations)
    - Netlify Forms (contact form, no backend)

    ## Getting started

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    ## Build

    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run preview
    ```

    ## Deploy (Netlify)

    - Build command: `npm run build`
    - Publish directory: `dist`
    - SPA redirect: `public/_redirects`

    Netlify Forms:
    - `index.html` contains a hidden copy of the form so Netlify can detect it at build time.
    - The visible form is in `src/App.tsx`.
